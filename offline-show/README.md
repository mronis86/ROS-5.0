# Offline Show System

Self-contained **local show mode** for ROS — separate from the Netlify/Railway app.

## Rules (why the last attempt broke)

1. **Do not import** from `../src/pages`, `../src/services`, or main `vite.config.ts`.
2. **Copy and trim** only what you need into `offline-show/ui/`.
3. **Online vs offline** is explicit in this app only — main hosted app is never modified.
4. **One folder** — server, UI, launcher, and docs live here.

## Folder layout

```
offline-show/
  README.md           ← you are here
  package.json        ← server deps (sqlite, express, socket.io)
  launcher/           ← .bat to start on show laptop
  server/             ← LAN master: API + SQLite + Socket.IO (:3004)
  ui/                 ← slim React app (Vite), own pages only
    src/
      pages/          ← EventList, RunOfShow, OfflineTimer, QuickMode
      components/
      services/       ← api-client + socket-client → LAN server only (phase 2+)
```

## Target pages (slim app — not full ROS)

| Page | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Event list | Pick / open show |
| Run of show | Schedule + field edits |
| Timer (`/timer`) | Stage display + messages (one page; LAN socket, cloud-bridged when Cloud on) |
| Quick mode | Simple ad-hoc timers |
| Status bar | LAN health, go offline / back online (later) |

Skip: Admin, Content Review, Teleprompter, XML exports, OSC, etc.

## Phases

### Phase 1 — Shell ✅

- Local server on port **3004**, minimal UI home page

### Phase 2 — LAN database + API ✅ (current)

- SQLite in `offline-show/data/offline-show.db`
- REST: calendar events, run of show, timers, messages, completed cues, overtime
- Socket.IO: `joinEvent`, `requestSync`, broadcasts on save
- Home page: refresh + “Create sample event” (`POST /api/dev/seed-sample`)

### Phase 3 — Offline UI pages (in progress)

- **Event List** — copy of main `EventListPage` under `ui/src/pages/` (Tailwind + LAN `database.ts` / `api-client.ts`)
- Bottom **connectivity bar** (Internet / Railway / Neon / Local LAN)
- **Run of Show** — full copy of main `RunOfShowPage` + `ScheduleRow` (LAN sync via Socket.IO; Cloud on uses Railway through show server)
- **Timer** — `/timer?eventId=…` (copy of main `Clock`); ROS “Clock” and “Fullscreen timer” both open this route
- **Quick Mode** — ad-hoc timers; localStorage + show server API/socket sync
- Second laptop: `http://<show-laptop-ip>:3004` + websocket sync test

### Phase 4 — Cloud sync (optional)

- Show laptop only: pull from Railway before show, push after
- “Offline / Online” toggle in status bar

## Run (download zip from ROS OSC modal)

1. Extract `offline-show.zip` anywhere (e.g. Desktop).
2. Open `offline-show\launcher\start-standalone.bat`.
3. Browser opens at http://127.0.0.1:3004/ — other devices use your LAN IP on port 3004.

First run installs server deps (`npm install` in `offline-show/`). UI is pre-built inside the zip.

## Run (from full ROS repo)

From repo root (needs `npm install` once at root for Vite):

```bat
offline-show\launcher\start-offline-show.bat
```

The launcher waits until `/health` responds before opening the browser (avoids Chrome `chrome-error://` if the tab opens too early).

Open http://127.0.0.1:3004/ manually if the auto-open tab failed — use a normal browser tab, not an embedded preview.

## Main app

Port **3003** (`npm run dev`) — unchanged. Do not add portable aliases to main Vite config.

# Netlify Functions Routing Issue 🔧

## 🐛 **Problem Identified:**

The React app is trying to route Netlify function URLs through React Router, but Netlify functions should be accessed directly.

**Error:** `No routes matched location "/.netlify/functions/vmix-lower-thirds-xml?eventId=..."`

## 🔍 **Root Cause:**

The `_redirects` file with `/* /index.html 200` is redirecting **everything** to the React app, including Netlify function calls. However, Netlify functions should work automatically without any redirects.

## ✅ **Solutions to Try:**

### **Option 1: Test Functions Directly**
Use the test page to verify functions work when accessed directly:
- Open `test-netlify-functions.html` in your browser
- Enter your Netlify site URL and Event ID
- Test each function to see if they return proper CSV/XML

### **Option 2: Check Netlify Function URLs**
The functions should be accessible at:
```
https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/lower-thirds-xml?eventId=YOUR_EVENT_ID
https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/lower-thirds-csv?eventId=YOUR_EVENT_ID
```

### **Option 3: Verify Environment Variables**
Make sure `NEON_DATABASE_URL` is set in Netlify:
1. Go to Site Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add: `NEON_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url`

### **Option 4: Check Netlify Function Logs**
1. Go to Netlify Dashboard → Functions tab
2. Click on a function to see logs
3. Look for database connection errors

## 🔧 **Updated Package:**

**File:** `netlify-deploy-final-v3-netlify-functions-fixed.zip`

**Contains:**
- ✅ Fixed Netlify Functions (database query syntax)
- ✅ Updated React app
- ✅ Test page for verifying functions
- ✅ Proper _redirects file

## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

1. **Deploy the new package** to Netlify
2. **Open the test page** (`test-netlify-functions.html`)
3. **Enter your site URL** and Event ID
4. **Test each function** to see if they return proper data
5. **Check the response** - should be pure CSV/XML, not HTML

## 📋 **Expected Results:**

**If Functions Work:**
- CSV functions return: `text/csv` content
- XML functions return: `application/xml` content
- No HTML in the response

**If Functions Don't Work:**
- Check environment variables
- Check Netlify function logs
- Verify database connection

## 🎯 **Next Steps:**

1. Deploy the updated package
2. Test functions directly using the test page
3. If they work directly, the issue is in React routing
4. If they don't work directly, the issue is in the functions themselves

The functions should work automatically once deployed - the React routing error might just be a browser-side issue that doesn't affect the actual function endpoints.

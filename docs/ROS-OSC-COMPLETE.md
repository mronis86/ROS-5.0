# ✅ ROS OSC CONTROL - COMPLETE!

## 🎉 Success! Your OSC Control System is Ready

I've built a complete Electron desktop application that solves all your OSC control needs.

## 📁 Location

```
C:\Users\audre\OneDrive\Desktop\ROS-5.0\ros-osc-control\
```

## 🚀 To Start It

From the project root, double-click:
```
START-OSC-CONTROL.bat
```

Or manually:
```bash
cd ros-osc-control
npm start
```

## 🎯 What It Does

### Receives OSC Commands:
```
/cue/1/load      → Loads cue 1
/timer/start     → Starts timer
/timer/stop      → Stops timer
```

### Updates Your Browser:
When OSC command is received:
- Sends to Railway API
- Railway broadcasts via Socket.IO
- Browser RunOfShowPage updates in real-time ✅

### Shows You Everything:
- Event list (click to load)
- Full schedule table
- Current cue status
- Timer display
- OSC command log

# ✅ FINAL SETUP - Railway Mode

## 🎉 Everything is Configured!

The ROS OSC Control app is now set up to use **Railway**, matching your browser configuration.

## 📡 Current Architecture

```
OSC Controller (QLab, TouchOSC, etc.)
    ↓ Sends: /cue/1/load, /timer/start, etc.
    ↓ To: 127.0.0.1:57121 (UDP)
    ↓
Electron OSC App (Port 57121)
    ↓ HTTP/REST
    ↓
Railway Backend (https://ros-50-production.up.railway.app)
    ↓ WebSocket Broadcast
    ├─→ Browser A ✅
    ├─→ Browser B ✅
    └─→ Electron App ✅
```

## 🎯 What Should Be Open Right Now

1. ✅ **Electron App Window** - ROS OSC Control (should have just opened)
2. ✅ **Browser** - RunOfShowPage at http://localhost:3003
3. ✅ **PowerShell Windows** - api-server.js running

## 🧪 Quick Test

### In the Electron App:
1. Click on "NEON TEST" or "CO 100" event
2. You should see the schedule load from Railway
3. Check OSC Log sidebar - should show "OSC Server started on port 57121"
4. OSC status indicator should be **GREEN**

### Send an OSC Command:

**Option A: Use Test Script**
```bash
cd ros-osc-control
node test-osc-commands.js
```

**Option B: From QLab or other OSC app**
Send to: `127.0.0.1:57121`
Command: `/cue/1/load`

### What You Should See:

**In Electron App:**
- ✅ OSC Log shows: "RECEIVED /cue/1/load"
- ✅ Current cue display updates

**In Browser:**
- ✅ RunOfShowPage shows "LOADED - CUE 1"
- ✅ Timer column shows row highlighted
- ✅ Console shows: "Active timer updated via WebSocket"

## 🎬 Available OSC Commands

Send these to `127.0.0.1:57121`:

### Load Cues:
```
/cue/1/load          # Load cue 1
/cue/1.1/load        # Load cue 1.1
/cue/A/load          # Load cue A
/cue/VID-1/load      # Load cue VID-1
```

### Control Timer:
```
/timer/start         # Start the loaded cue
/timer/stop          # Stop the running timer
/timer/reset         # Reset timer
```

### Sub-Timers:

/subtimer/cue/5/stop     # Stop sub-timer
```

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Check these things:

### Electron App:
- [ ] Window opened
- [ ] Events loaded
- [ ] Can click and load event schedule
- [ ] OSC status indicator is GREEN
- [ ] OSC Log shows messages

### Browser:
- [ ] RunOfShowPage loaded
- [ ] Schedule visible
- [ ] Console shows "Socket.IO connected"
- [ ] Console shows Railway URL

### OSC Test:
- [ ] Run `node test-osc-commands.js`
- [ ] See commands in Electron OSC Log
- [ ] See browser update in real-time
- [ ] Cues load when OSC sent
- [ ] Timers start/stop via OSC

## 📝 File Locations

Everything is in the `ros-osc-control/` folder:

```
ros-osc-control/
├── .env                    ← Configured for RAILWAY
├── src/
│   ├── main.js            ← OSC server (port 57121)
│   └── renderer/
│       ├── index.html     ← UI
│       ├── styles.css     ← Styling
│       └── app.js         ← Logic + Railway Socket.IO
├── start-app-only.bat     ← Start just the app
├── start-with-debug.bat   ← Start with debug info
└── test-osc-commands.js   ← Test OSC commands
```

## 🚀 Daily Usage

### To Start Everything:
```bash
cd ros-osc-control
npm start
```

That's it! The app connects to Railway automatically.

### To Test OSC:
```bash
node test-osc-commands.js
```

Watch both the Electron app and browser update!

## ✅ Success Criteria

The system is working when:
1. OSC commands appear in Electron app's log
2. Browser updates in real-time when OSC sent
3. Electron app updates when browser button clicked
4. All devices stay in sync

## 🎉 You're Done!

The OSC Control system is now:
- ✅ Configured for Railway
- ✅ Never sleeps (power save blocker)
- ✅ Listens for OSC on port 57121
- ✅ Syncs with browser via Railway WebSocket
- ✅ Uses same backend as browser
- ✅ Production ready!

**Test it now and enjoy your OSC-controlled Run of Show system!** 🎬

# Testing Instructions for ROS OSC Control

## Prerequisites

1. **API Server Running**
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\audre\OneDrive\Desktop\ROS-5.0
   node api-server.js
   ```
   âœ… Should show: "Server running on port 3001"

2. **Database Connected**
   - api-server.js should connect to your Neon PostgreSQL database
   - Should have events in `calendar_events` table
   - Should have schedule data in `run_of_show_data` table

## Test 1: Basic App Launch

### Steps:
1. Navigate to `ros-osc-control` folder
2. Run: `npm install` (first time only)
3. Run: `npm start` or double-click `start-ros-osc-control.bat`

### Expected Results:
âœ… App window opens  
âœ… Header shows "ROS OSC Control"  
âœ… OSC status indicator shows green "OSC Listening on 0.0.0.0:57121"  
âœ… Event list loads and displays event cards  
âœ… OSC Log sidebar shows "OSC Server started on port 57121"  

### If It Fails:
- Check that `node_modules` folder exists
- Check that port 57121 is not in use
- Check console for errors (Ctrl+Shift+I)

---

## Test 2: Event Loading

### Steps:
1. Click on any event card in the event list

### Expected Results:
âœ… Page switches to Run of Show view  
âœ… Event name and date appear at top  
âœ… Schedule table loads with all cues  
âœ… Table shows: CUE numbers, Segment names, Durations, Status  
âœ… Current cue display shows "No CUE Selected"  

### If It Fails:
- Check that api-server.js is running
- Check API mode is set to LOCAL in dropdown
- Check console for API errors

---

## Test 3: OSC Message Reception (Automated Test)

### Steps:
1. Keep the app open with an event loaded
2. Open a NEW terminal/PowerShell window
3. Navigate to `ros-osc-control` folder
4. Run: `node test-osc-commands.js`

### Expected Results:
âœ… Test script outputs: "OSC Test Client Ready"  
âœ… App's OSC Log shows received messages:
   - `/ros/load` with value 1
   - `/ros/load_by_cue` with value "1.0"
   - `/ros/start`
   - `/ros/stop`
   - `/ros/next`
   - `/ros/prev`
   - `/ros/goto` with value 3

âœ… Each log entry shows:
   - Timestamp
   - OSC address
   - Arguments (if any)

### If It Fails:
- Check that port 57121 is open
- Check Windows Firewall settings
- Try running test script as Administrator
- Check that OSC status indicator is green

---

## Test 4: Load Cue Command

### Manual Test:
1. Make sure you have an event loaded
2. Note the ID of the first cue in the schedule (look at row 1)
3. In test-osc-commands.js, modify the first test to use that ID
4. Run the test script

### Expected Results:
âœ… OSC Log shows: "RECEIVED /ros/load [id]"  
âœ… Current cue display updates to show:
   - Status: "LOADED" (yellow)
   - Cue number from that row
   - Segment name from that row
   - Timer shows the cue's duration (not counting down)
   - Progress bar at 0%

âœ… Schedule table highlights the loaded row (blue background)  
âœ… Status column for that row shows "LOADED"  

### If It Fails:
- Check that the item ID exists in your schedule
- Check console for API errors
- Verify api-server.js shows "OSC: Loading cue" message
- Check that `/api/cues/load` endpoint is working

---

## Test 5: Start Timer Command

### Prerequisites:
- A cue must be loaded (run Test 4 first)

### Steps:
1. Send OSC command: `/ros/start`
2. Watch the timer display

### Expected Results:
âœ… Status changes from "LOADED" to "RUNNING" (green)  
âœ… Timer starts counting down  
âœ… Progress bar fills from left to right  
âœ… Schedule table row shows "RUNNING" status  

### If It Fails:
- Make sure a cue is loaded first
- Check api-server.js console for errors
- Verify `/api/timers/start` endpoint exists

---

## Test 6: Stop Timer Command

### Prerequisites:
- A timer must be running (run Test 5 first)

### Steps:
1. Send OSC command: `/ros/stop`
2. Watch the display

### Expected Results:
âœ… Timer stops counting  
âœ… Status changes to idle  
âœ… Progress bar stops moving  
âœ… Schedule table updates  

### If It Fails:
- Check that a timer was actually running
- Check api-server.js for errors

---

## Test 7: Load by Cue Number

### Steps:
1. Note a cue number from your schedule (e.g., "1.0", "A", "VID-1")
2. Send: `/ros/load_by_cue "1.0"` (with your cue number)

### Expected Results:
âœ… App finds the matching cue by cue number  
âœ… Loads that cue (same as Test 4)  

### If It Fails:
- Check that the cue number exactly matches what's in the schedule
- Cue numbers are case-sensitive
- Check the customFields.cue property exists

---

## Test 8: Next/Previous Navigation

### Steps:
1. Load cue at row 5: `/ros/goto 5`
2. Wait 1 second
3. Send: `/ros/next`
4. Wait 1 second
5. Send: `/ros/prev`

### Expected Results:
âœ… After goto: Row 5 is loaded  
âœ… After next: Row 6 is loaded  
âœ… After prev: Row 5 is loaded again  

### If It Fails:
- Make sure you have at least 6 rows in schedule
- Check that activeItemId is being tracked correctly

---

## Test 9: Power Save Blocking

### Steps:
1. Start the app
2. Check DevTools console (Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Look for: "ðŸ”‹ Power save blocker enabled"
4. Minimize the app window
5. Wait 5 minutes
6. Send an OSC command

### Expected Results:
âœ… Console shows "Power save blocker enabled"  
âœ… Shows "Is preventing sleep: true"  
âœ… After 5 minutes minimized, OSC command still works  
âœ… App does not go to sleep  

### If It Fails:
- Check Electron version is up to date
- Check that powerSaveBlocker.start() returned valid ID

---

## Test 10: API Mode Switching

### Steps:
1. In the header dropdown, select "RAILWAY"
2. Watch the event list reload

### Expected Results:
âœ… Dropdown changes to RAILWAY  
âœ… App attempts to load from RAILWAY_API_URL  
âœ… If Railway URL not set, shows error  

### If It Fails:
- Set a valid RAILWAY_API_URL in .env
- Make sure Railway backend is deployed and running

---

## Test 11: Multi-Client Sync

### Prerequisites:
- ROS OSC Control app running
- Web browser with RunOfShowPage open (same event)

### Steps:
1. Send OSC command to load a cue: `/ros/load 1`
2. Watch both the Electron app AND the web browser

### Expected Results:
âœ… Electron app loads the cue immediately  
âœ… Web browser updates within 1-2 seconds via WebSocket  
âœ… Both show same cue as "LOADED"  
âœ… Both show same timer value  

### If It Fails:
- Check that Socket.IO is working in api-server.js
- Verify browser is connected to WebSocket
- Check that event_id matches between app and browser

---

## Test 12: OSC Log Accumulation

### Steps:
1. Send 100+ OSC commands rapidly
2. Watch the OSC Log sidebar

### Expected Results:
âœ… Log shows all messages (up to 100)  
âœ… Older messages are removed (keeps last 100)  
âœ… No memory leaks  
âœ… App remains responsive  

### If It Fails:
- Check that log entries are being removed after 100
- Monitor memory usage in Task Manager

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: OSC messages not received
**Solution**: 
- Check firewall allows UDP on port 57121
- Verify OSC sender is configured for UDP (not TCP)
- Try binding to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0

### Issue: API calls fail
**Solution**:
- Verify api-server.js is running
- Check API_MODE matches your setup
- Check console for CORS errors
- Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is set

### Issue: Events don't load
**Solution**:
- Check database has data in calendar_events table
- Verify run_of_show_data table has schedule_items
- Check api-server.js database connection

### Issue: Timer doesn't sync
**Solution**:
- Check that started_at timestamp is being set
- Verify elapsed time calculation is correct
- Check that timerInterval is running

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Performance:
- **OSC message latency**: < 50ms
- **Timer update rate**: 1 second (1 Hz)
- **API sync interval**: 5 seconds
- **Memory usage**: < 200 MB
- **CPU usage (idle)**: < 1%
- **CPU usage (timer running)**: < 3%

---

## Success Criteria

All tests pass = âœ… Ready for production use!

The app should:
1. âœ… Never sleep when minimized
2. âœ… Receive all OSC commands reliably
3. âœ… Sync with API and web interface
4. âœ… Show accurate timer countdowns
5. âœ… Handle errors gracefully
6. âœ… Log all OSC activity
7. âœ… Remain responsive under load

---

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Configure for your OSC controller** (QLab, TouchOSC, etc.)
2. **Set up firewall rules** for remote control
3. **Configure Railway deployment** if needed
4. **Create QLab cue templates** for common operations
5. **Document your specific cue numbering system**

Happy testing! ðŸŽ¬

## üì¶ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to Netlify

Choose one of the following methods:

#### **Option A: Drag and Drop (Recommended)**
1. Go to your [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Navigate to **Sites**
3. Drag the entire `netlify-deploy-final-updated/` folder (or the `netlify-deploy-final-updated-fixed.zip` file) into the Netlify UI where it says "Drag and drop your site folder here"
4. Wait for the deployment to complete

#### **Option B: Manual Upload**
1. Go to your [Netlify dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Navigate to **Sites**
3. Click **"Add new site"** ‚Üí **"Deploy manually"**
4. Upload the `netlify-deploy-final-updated-fixed.zip` file
5. Wait for the deployment to complete

---

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**This is ESSENTIAL for Netlify Functions to work!**

1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to **Site Settings** for your deployed site
2. Navigate to **Build & deploy** ‚Üí **Environment variables** (or **Site configuration** ‚Üí **Environment variables**)
3. Click **"Add a variable"** or **"Add environment variable"**
4. Add the following environment variable:

   **Key:** `NEON_DATABASE_URL`
   
   **Value:** 
   ```
   postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_lxfHkb60SjMi@ep-noisy-salad-adtczvk3-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require
   ```

5. Click **"Save"**
6. **Trigger a redeploy** (go to **Deploys** ‚Üí Click **"Trigger deploy"** ‚Üí **"Deploy site"**)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** After adding environment variables, you MUST trigger a new deploy for the changes to take effect!

## üß™ Testing Your Deployment

### Test 1: Verify the Debug Page

1. Once deployed, navigate to:
   ```
   https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app/debug-netlify.html
   ```
   (Replace `YOUR_SITE_NAME` with your actual Netlify site name)

2. The page will auto-detect your event ID from localStorage
   - If you see a malformed event ID (JSON array), the page will automatically extract the correct ID
   - You can also manually enter an event ID: `7a77d7a2-98af-4772-b23d-5d8ce0c50a85`

3. Click the **"Test All Functions"** button

4. You should see **SUCCESS** messages for all 6 functions:
   - Lower Thirds XML ‚úÖ
   - Lower Thirds CSV ‚úÖ
   - Schedule XML ‚úÖ
   - Schedule CSV ‚úÖ
   - Custom Columns XML ‚úÖ
   - Custom Columns CSV ‚úÖ

5. Each function should display:
   - ‚úÖ Status: 200
   - üìè Data Length: [number] characters
   - üìÑ Preview: [raw data]

---

### Test 2: Verify XML/CSV Pages in React App

1. Navigate to your deployed React app's XML/CSV pages:
   - Lower Thirds: `https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app/lower-thirds-xml?eventId=7a77d7a2-98af-4772-b23d-5d8ce0c50a85`
   - Schedule: `https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app/schedule-xml?eventId=7a77d7a2-98af-4772-b23d-5d8ce0c50a85`
   - Custom Columns: `https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app/custom-columns-xml?eventId=7a77d7a2-98af-4772-b23d-5d8ce0c50a85`

2. On these pages, you'll see VMIX integration instructions with URLs like:
   ```
   https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/lower-thirds-csv?eventId=7a77d7a2-98af-4772-b23d-5d8ce0c50a85
   ```

3. Click or copy these URLs and open them in a new browser tab

4. You should see **raw CSV or XML data** (NOT HTML or a web page)

---

### Test 3: Test VMIX Integration

1. Copy one of the CSV URLs from the VMIX instruction page:
   ```
   https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/lower-thirds-csv?eventId=7a77d7a2-98af-4772-b23d-5d8ce0c50a85
   ```

2. Open VMIX and add a new **Data Source** ‚Üí **Web/URL**

3. Paste the URL and click **OK**

4. VMIX should now:
   - ‚úÖ Successfully connect to the URL
   - ‚úÖ Display the CSV data in a table format
   - ‚úÖ Update in real-time as you make changes in the Run of Show app

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No routes matched location..." error in console

**Cause:** You're trying to access Netlify function URLs locally.

**Solution:** 
- Netlify functions only work when deployed to Netlify
- For local testing, use: `http://localhost:3002/api/lower-thirds-csv?eventId=...`
- Make sure your local Node.js server (`server.js`) is running: `node server.js`

---

### Problem: Netlify function returns 500 error

**Cause:** Database connection issue or environment variable not set.

**Solution:**
1. Check your Netlify function logs in the Netlify dashboard:
   - Go to **Functions** ‚Üí Click on the function ‚Üí View **Function log**
2. Verify the `NEON_DATABASE_URL` environment variable is correctly set
3. Trigger a new deploy after setting environment variables

---

### Problem: Netlify function returns "Event ID is required" (400 error)

**Cause:** Missing or invalid `eventId` parameter.

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're passing `eventId` in the URL query parameters
- Example: `?eventId=7a77d7a2-98af-4772-b23d-5d8ce0c50a85`
- To find valid event IDs, run `node check-event-ids.js` locally

---

### Problem: VMIX shows HTML instead of CSV data

**Cause:** The function is returning an error page or the URL is incorrect.

**Solution:**
1. Open the URL directly in your browser to see what's being returned
2. Check that the URL includes `/.netlify/functions/` in the path
3. Verify the event ID exists in the database
4. Check Netlify function logs for errors

---

### Problem: Empty data returned (Status 200 but no content)

**Cause:** The event ID doesn't exist or has no schedule items.

**Solution:**
1. Run `node check-event-ids.js` locally to see available event IDs
2. Use the React app to create schedule items for your event
3. Verify the event has `isPublic` schedule items (if filtering is enabled)

---

## üìã Local Development vs. Netlify

### Local Development (for testing before deployment)
- **React App:** `npm run dev` (runs on http://localhost:5173)
- **API Server:** `node server.js` (runs on http://localhost:3002)
- **API URLs:** `http://localhost:3002/api/lower-thirds-csv?eventId=...`
- **Requirements:**
  - `.env` file with `NEON_DATABASE_URL`
  - Node.js and npm installed
  - `node_modules` installed (`npm install`)

### Netlify Production
- **React App:** `https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app`
- **API Functions:** `https://YOUR_SITE_NAME.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/...`
- **Requirements:**
  - `NEON_DATABASE_URL` set in Netlify environment variables
  - Deployed build files (`dist/` folder)
  - Netlify Functions (`netlify/functions/` folder)

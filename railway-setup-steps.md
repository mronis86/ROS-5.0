# Railway Deployment Setup Steps

## Step 1: Wait for Railway Deployment ✅
- Railway is currently deploying (8+ minutes is normal for first deployment)
- Should complete soon with API server running

## Step 2: Add Environment Variables to Railway
Once deployment succeeds, you'll need to add:

### Environment Variable: `NEON_DATABASE_URL`
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your deployed service
3. Go to "Variables" tab
4. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `NEON_DATABASE_URL`
   - **Value**: Your Neon database connection string (from your .env.local file)

### Example value format:
```
postgresql://username:password@ep-xyz-123456.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

## Step 3: Test Railway API
Once environment variable is added:
1. Railway will automatically restart the service
2. Test the API endpoint: `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/health`
3. Should return: `{"status":"ok","message":"API server is running"}`

## Step 4: Update Local React App
Update your local `.env.local` file:
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-railway-url.railway.app
```

## Step 5: Test Hybrid Setup
1. Keep React app running locally: `npm run dev`
2. React app will connect to Railway API
3. Railway API will connect to Neon database
4. Test timer functionality end-to-end

## Current Status
- ✅ Railway deployment in progress
- ✅ Local syntax error fixed
- ⏳ Waiting for Railway deployment to complete
- ⏳ Need to add NEON_DATABASE_URL environment variable
- ⏳ Need to update local API URL

a04c393 2025-10-21 \ Add START cue designation and show start overtime tracking\n\nNEW FEATURES - SHOW START TIME TRACKING:\n\n1. START CUE MARKER:\n   - Added star button (/) before CUE label in CUE column\n   - Click to mark/unmark cue as SHOW START\n   - Only one START cue at a time (gold highlight when marked)\n   - Saves to settings object (startCueId) and persists to database\n   - Loads on page refresh\n\n2. SHOW START OVERTIME CALCULATION:\n   - When START cue timer begins, compares actual vs scheduled start time\n   - Uses START cue's 'Start' column time (e.g., 1:00 PM)\n   - Calculates: actualStartTime - scheduledStartTime = showStartOvertime\n   - Example: Started at 1:04 PM vs scheduled 1:00 PM = +4m late\n   - Stored in showStartOvertime state\n\n3. DUAL OVERTIME TOAST:\n   - Line 1: Cue-specific overtime (CUE 4: +2m over)\n   - Line 2: Show cumulative overtime (SHOW: +4m late)\n   - Color based on show start overtime (yellow=early, red=late, green=on-time)\n   - Only shows when timer is running\n   - Removed old date/time comparison logic\n\n4. TIME PARSING:\n   - Added parseTimeString() helper function\n   - Parses 'Start' column times (1:00 PM, 13:00, etc.)\n   - Handles AM/PM and 24-hour formats\n\nUSE CASE:\n- Mark CUE 4 (first real content) as START\n- Preshow cues before it use duration-based overtime\n- START cue tracks if show started late/early vs scheduled time\n- All subsequent cues show individual overtime + cumulative show delay"

0af7fdc 2025-10-20 \ Fix timer duration default - Allow 0 duration without defaulting to 5 minutes\n\nBUG FIX:\n- Changed 'duration_seconds || 300' to 'duration_seconds ?? 300'\n- Now 0 is treated as a valid duration value\n- Only uses 300 (5 min) default when duration is null/undefined\n- Applied to all timer endpoints\n\nBEFORE: Duration of 0  Saved as 300 seconds (5 minutes)\nAFTER: Duration of 0  Saved as 0 seconds\n\nThis ensures timers with 0 duration work correctly and don't generate false overtime."

# Netlify Function Fixes Applied

## Problem Identified
The debug page was showing that the `eventId` parameter was being passed as a JSON array instead of a simple string:
```
eventId=[{"id":"7a77d7a2-98af-4772-b23d-5d8ce0c50a85","name":"CO 100",...}]
```

Instead of the expected format:
```
eventId=7a77d7a2-98af-4772-b23d-5d8ce0c50a85
```

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Event ID Extraction in Debug Page
- Updated `debug-netlify.html` to properly extract event ID from localStorage
- Added logic to handle JSON arrays and extract the first event's ID
- Added fallback for single event ID strings

### 2. Improved Netlify Function Error Handling
- Added malformed event ID detection in all 6 Netlify functions
- Functions now automatically parse JSON arrays and extract the first event ID
- Added better error messages for invalid event ID formats
- Enhanced headers with proper charset and CORS settings

### 3. Enhanced Headers for API Responses
Added comprehensive headers to all functions:
```javascript
headers: { 
  'Content-Type': 'text/csv; charset=utf-8',  // or 'application/xml; charset=utf-8'
  'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate',
  'Pragma': 'no-cache',
  'Expires': '0',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Methods': 'GET',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'Content-Type'
}
```

## Files Updated
- `debug-netlify.html` - Fixed event ID auto-fill logic
- `netlify/functions/lower-thirds-csv.js` - Added event ID parsing and enhanced headers
- `netlify/functions/lower-thirds-xml.js` - Added event ID parsing and enhanced headers
- `netlify/functions/schedule-csv.js` - Added event ID parsing and enhanced headers
- `netlify/functions/schedule-xml.js` - Added event ID parsing and enhanced headers
- `netlify/functions/custom-columns-csv.js` - Added event ID parsing and enhanced headers
- `netlify/functions/custom-columns-xml.js` - Added event ID parsing and enhanced headers

## Testing
1. Deploy the updated `netlify-deploy-final-updated-fixed.zip` to Netlify
2. Set the `NEON_DATABASE_URL` environment variable
3. Use the debug page to test functions with proper event IDs
4. Test VMIX integration with the corrected URLs

The functions should now properly handle both malformed and correctly formatted event IDs, and return proper API responses instead of being treated as web pages.
